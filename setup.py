Inspector is a re-implementation of Andrew Moffat's Inspect-Shell
(https://github.com/amoffat/Inspect-Shell).


What it does
------------

Inspector allows you to read, change or add global variables of your Python
program from another process (a shell) while your program is running.

You could, for example, add a whole class to your program from the shell and
rewrite some function so that it starts using your newly-created class. All that
while your program continues to run! Yes, that's pretty cool.


How it works
------------

Inspector has 2 modes; server mode and shell mode. Server mode is run by your
Python program (in a separate thread), while the shell mode is run by the
inspector itself.

Steps:

1. add `import inspector` to your program
2. run your program
3. run the inspector with `python inspector.py`
4. type code into the shell

Inspector also supports tab completion for your program's variables.

After you're done, exit the shell by pressing Ctrl-D or Ctrl-C, or typing
`exit`. You program will continue to run with all the changes made. You can run
the inspector again anytime you want.

You can also import the inspector from a Python shell if you just want to see
how it works.

Inspector works with Python 2 and 3. See https://github.com/jzib/inspector for
more information.
