_Inspector_ is a re-implementation of Andrew Moffat's
[Inspect-Shell](https://github.com/amoffat/Inspect-Shell). At the moment it
doesn't support saving shell history to a file or auto-completion

It runs with both Python 2 and 3. Since the server (inspector importer) and the
client (inspector shell) are separate processes, you can even run one side
in Python 3 and the other in Python 2. Everything you type into the shell will
be evaluated with server's Python version though.


Example
-------

### Importer's side

The file that imports inspector will run a server. Importing the inspector
is enough.

```python
import time
import inspector

a = 1
b = 10
limit = 600
update = lambda n: n + 1

while a <= limit:
    if a % b == 0:
        print(a, b)
    a = update(a)
    time.sleep(1)
```

You can also import the inspector from a Python shell if you want to just test
how it works.


### Inspector's side

Run the inspector shell with `python inspector.py`. I advise  you to create a
symlink to the inspector.py somewhere on your `$PATH`, so that you can run it
from anywhere.

    <Inspector @ localhost:2971 (importer_file_name.py)>
    >>> a
    9
    >>> a = 100
    >>> a
    102
    >>> b = 2
    >>> update = lambda n: n * 2
    >>> a = 1
    >>> limit = 4096


Options
-------

 - `inspector.VERBOSE` level of status updates
 - `inspector.HOST`
 - `inspector.PORT`
 - `inspector.TIMEOUT_SERVER`
 - `inspector.TIMEOUT_CLIENT`
 - `inspector.PASSPHRASE` to ensure nobody is messing with your variables' values
 - `inspector.CHUNK_SIZE` of each message chunk that is recieved
