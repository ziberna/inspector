_Inspector_ is a re-implementation of Andrew Moffat's
[Inspect-Shell](https://github.com/amoffat/Inspect-Shell). At the moment it
doesn't support saving shell history to a file or auto-completion

It runs with both Python 2 and 3. Since the server (inspector importer) and the
client (inspector shell) are separate processes, you can even run one side
in Python 3 and the other in Python 2. Everything you type into the shell will
be evaluated with server's Python version though.


Example
-------

### Importer's side

```python
# All you need to do is to import inspector
import inspector

import time

a = 1
b = 10
limit = 600
update = lambda n: n + 1

while a <= limit:
    if a % b == 0:
        print(a, b)
    a = update(a)
    time.sleep(1)
```

You can also import the inspector from a Python shell if you just want to see
how it works.


### Inspector's side

Run the inspector shell with `python inspector.py`. 

    [jure@Kant inspector]$ python inspector.py
    <Inspector @ localhost:2971 (importer_file_name.py)>
    >>> a
    9
    >>> a = 100
    >>> a
    102
    >>> b = 1
    >>> def update(n):
    ...     if n % 2:
    ...         n = n // 2
    ...     else:
    ...         n = n * 3 + 1
    ...     return n
    ...
    >>> a = 1000

Create a symlink to the inspector.py somewhere on your `$PATH`, so that you can
run it from anywhere.
